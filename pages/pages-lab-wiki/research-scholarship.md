## Integraty.
 Research ethics is very important. Always report what you see. One should never manipulate data/results under any circumstances. 

## Note-keeping.
 Be a good note keeper. It will help you in the long run. Notes will help you organize your thoughts. Notes help you remember what you did months ago. 


## Reserach directions. 
 * Focus on the most important direction, and try not to be distracted by too much details.
 * Keep record of even very small but interesting findings, they could turn out to be something huge.

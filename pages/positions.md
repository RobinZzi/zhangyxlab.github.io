Our lab will be openning Januanry/Februrary 2022. Stay tuned!<br> 
We're looking for young talents at all levels to join our team. If you are excited about making discoveries about cancer and aging, or invotating genomics/bioinformatics tools, please don't hesitate to contact me. Below is a list of positions and applicaiton procedure. 

### Post-doctoral positions
We're recuiting both experimental and computational postdoctoral fellows. Outstanding candidate will also be considered for a research assistant professor position. Please refer to this [Job Ad|博士后招聘]({{ site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/files/postdoc_ad.pdf) for more details.  
 * For experimental position, an ideal candidate should have obtained a PhD degree in experimental-biology-related field, and have experiences in molecular biology, biochemistry, cell culture, genomics and other “wet lab” techniques. Experience in epigenetics or CRISPR genome editing is highly desirable.
 * For computational position, an ideal candidate should have obtained a PhD degree in quantitative science field. Skills to program and analyze large-scale datasets or to develop algorithms and statistical methods to analyze data are required. Candidates with experience in epigenomics, single-cell genomics or strong background in computation/statistics will be highly desirable. We also welcome candidates with a non-computational PhD but with strong interest and experience in computation and programing to apply.

### Graduate students
We're actively recruiting graduate students, especially for projects related to Bioinformatics and Genomics. Please contact me if you're interested in a rotation, or would like to consider applying to graduate programs @Westlake.  

### Research assistants
We're recruiting 2-3 research assistants to help build a brand-new lab and help generate or analyze exciting single-cell datasets. Please see [Job Ad|研究助理招聘]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/files/research_assistant_ad.pdf) for more details. 


### Visiting students 
Our lab is open to motivated undergraduate students who would like to do summer/winter internship or work on undergraduate thesis projects. If you're interested please contact me at zhangyanxiao@westlake.edu.cn.

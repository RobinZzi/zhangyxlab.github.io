I"Ù<p><b> About the PI </b>: Dr. Yanxiao Zhang received his bachelorâ€™s degree in Biotechnology from Beijing University in 2010. He then obtained a PhD degree in Bioinformatics (advisor: Dr. Maureen Sartor) and masterâ€™s degree in Statistics from the University of Michigan in 2016. He completed his postdoctoral work in Dr. Bing Renâ€™s lab at Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research (UCSD branch), studying the dynamics of chromatin states during mammalian development (as part of ENCODE) and 3-dimenstional chromatin structure.

<p><b> About the Lab </b>: Our lab will use computational and functional genomics tools to study the mechanisms of aging and cancer, with a primary focus on epigenetic regulations. We will investigate how the dysfunction of heterochromatin, repetitive elements and transposons contributes to the oncogenic and aging processes.</p>

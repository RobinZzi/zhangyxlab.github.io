I"B<p><b> About the PI </b>: Dr. Yanxiao Zhang received his bachelor’s degree in Biotechnology from Beijing University in 2010. He then obtained a PhD degree in Bioinformatics (advisor: Dr. <a href="http://sartorlab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/"> Maureen Sartor</a>) and master’s degree in Statistics from the University of Michigan in 2016. He completed his postdoctoral work in <a href="http://renlab.sdsc.edu/renlab_website/">Dr. Bing Ren’s</a> lab at Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research (UCSD branch), studying the dynamics of chromatin states during mammalian development (as part of ENCODE) and 3-dimenstional chromatin structure.

<p><b> About the Lab </b>: Our lab will use computational and functional genomics tools to study the mechanisms of aging and cancer, with a primary focus on epigenetic regulations. We will investigate how the dysfunction of heterochromatin, repetitive elements and transposons contributes to the oncogenic and aging processes.</p>

These files are supplementary to the ENCODE3 mouse paper. 

Raw and processed ChIP-seq data from our study can be accessed via the ENCODE Data Collection and Coordination (DCC) website: www.encodedcc.org. 

A full list of the ChIP-seq experiments included in this manuscript can be found at the link below:  https://www.encodeproject.org/search/?type=Experiment&assay_title=ChIP-seq&award.rfa=ENCODE3&lab.title=Bing+Ren%2C+UCSD&limit=all

A fill list of ATAC-seq experiments included in this manuscript can be found at the link below:  
https://www.encodeproject.org/search/?type=Experiment&award.rfa=ENCODE3&lab.title=Bing+Ren%2C+UCSD&limit=all.&assay_title=ATAC-seq&limit=all"

- chromHMM calls (currently here)
- your dynamic enhancer calls (with a readme file about how to interpret)
- Yuan's dynamic ATAC calls (with a readme file about how to interpret)
- Yuan's processed ATAC data, if different then ENCODE DCC (should be described in methods).

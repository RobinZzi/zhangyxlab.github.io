These files are supplementary to the ENCODE3 mouse paper. 

- Raw and processed ChIP-seq data from our study can be accessed via the ENCODE Data Collection and Coordination (DCC) website: 

<http://www.encodedcc.org>. 
- A full list of the ChIP-seq experiments included in this manuscript can be found at the link below:

- A full list of ATAC-seq experiments included in this manuscript can be found at the link below:

- [chromHMM calls](http://enhancer.sdsc.edu/enhancer_export/ENCODE/chromHMM/)
- [H3K27ac dynamic enhancer calls](/renlab_website/download_files/ENCODE3_mouse_dynamic_H3K27ac_peaks.txt.gz)
- Yuan's dynamic ATAC calls (with a readme file about how to interpret)
- Yuan's processed ATAC data, if different then ENCODE DCC (should be described in methods).

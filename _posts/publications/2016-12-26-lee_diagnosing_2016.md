    abstract: " Colorectal medullary carcinoma, recognized by the World-Health-Organization as a  distinct histologic subtype, is commonly regarded as a specific entity with an improved prognosis and unique molecular pathogenesis. A fundamental but as-yet unaddressed question, however, is whether it can be diagnosed reproducibly. In this study, by analyzing 80 colorectal adenocarcinomas whose dominant growth pattern was solid (thus encompassing medullary carcinoma and its mimics), we provided a detailed description of the morphological spectrum from classic medullary histology to non-medullary poorly-differentiated histologies and demonstrated significant overlapping between categories. By assessing a selected  subset (n"

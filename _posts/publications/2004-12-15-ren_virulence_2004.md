    abstract: " Complement is important for elimination of invasive microbes from the host, an action achieved largely through interaction of complement-decorated pathogens with various complement receptors (CR) on phagocytes. Pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) has been shown to interfere with complement deposition onto pneumococci, but to date the impact of PspA on CR-mediated host defense is unknown. To gauge the contribution of CRs to host defense against pneumococci and to decipher the impact of PspA on CR-dependent host defense, wild-type C57BL/6J mice and mutant mice lacking CR types 1 and 2 (CR1/2(-/-)), CR3 (CR3(-/-)), or CR4 (CR4(-/-)) were challenged with WU2, a PspA(+) capsular serotype 3 pneumococcus, and its PspA(-) mutant JY1119. Pneumococci also were used to challenge factor D-deficient (FD(-/-)), LFA-1-deficient (LFA-1(-/-)), and,"

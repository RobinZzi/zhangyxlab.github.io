    abstract: " AIM: To evaluate the efficacy, safety and stability of posterior chamber phakic intraocular lens implantation for the correction of high myopia. METHODS: Retrospective case review of 82 eyes (43 patients) undergoing implantable Collamer lens (ICL) placement by a single surgeon (Xiao-Wei Gao) to correct preoperative mean spherical equivalents between -9.00 diopter (D) and -23.00D. Main outcome measures included uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), refraction, best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA), endothelial cell density (ECD), intraocular pressure (IOP), lens transparency, postoperative uveitis. Visante anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) was used to measure anterior chamber depth (ACD) and the position of ICL. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 6.54+/-3.26 months (range 3-12 months). Predictability of the manifest spherical  equivalent (SE) refraction to within +/-1.00D was achieved in 88% of eyes and +/-0.50D in 72.5% of eyes. The mean postoperative manifest SE refraction was -1.85+/-0.72D, with 96.34% of eyes maintaining or gaining textgreater/"

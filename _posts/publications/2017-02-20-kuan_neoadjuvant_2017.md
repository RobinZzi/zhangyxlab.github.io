    abstract: " Universal screening using immunohistochemistry for DNA mismatch-repair (MMR) proteins (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2) is advocated by major professional medical  organizations to identify Lynch syndrome-associated colorectal carcinoma. Loss of MSH6 expression independent of MSH2 expression has been reported in microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal carcinoma following neoadjuvant therapy. The mechanism remains unclear. We studied the immunohistochemical expression of MSH2, MSH6, and Ki67 in MSS colorectal carcinoma with (n"

    abstract: " OBJECTIVE: To monitor the change of renin, endothelin and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1alpha in canine during left ventricular assist (LVA). METHODS: Eight canines were assisted by left assist ventricular device for 9 hours. The level of renin,  endothelin and 6-keto-prostaglandin f1alpha in plasma were measured by radioimmunity analysis before assisting (control group) and at 3 hours, at 6 hours, at 9 hours after assisting. RESULTS: The level of endothelin in plasma didn't dropped remarkably as LVA proceeded in which there was not differency in statistical diffency compared with control group[(51 +/- 11) ng/L, (42 +/- 8) ng/L, t "
